to-do:



- change colour of circles to white on the day viewer and the year viewer, white with black outline?

- test different colours e.g. whtie in middle of circle for yellow-blue gradient?

- update rest of accents from green to blue etc , see if a more faded blue would look better on
the buttons?





- add relative daily sun intensity e.g. 80% at 14:00 and then 20% at like midnight or whatever
for each day, this will also allow you to see the time of day for a given intensity etc ... 

    - this is implemented, but it needs to be fixed to work properly





done:


- change color of tick marks on circle from red to black

- fix seasons viewer alignment on header
