--> don't know what to do next


  - go through all potential featuers and see which ones feel right to work on 
    - some things may not feel impactful enough to work, others may feel too grand and like there are other issues to deal with first
    - features that feel right might be ones that are important, often for UX - might not be obvious in the UI you see




      - examples & previous:
        - the right click menu for habits --- you can't tell this is missing by looking at the app, but is a really important UX feature
