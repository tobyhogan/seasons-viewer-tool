What is stopping me from using habitazen instead of ticktick?

- Habitazen has no "mark habits as incomplete", like with an X, for the current day, so it still feels like you need to do them
- Habitazen has no way to group habits into seperate folders
- Habitazen has no way to color code habits




What features will the habit tracker have that TickTick does not?

- Ability to custom track habits e.g. you want to go over your goal, but still have it contribute to your statistics and see
the analytics for it

- Not having any features or purposes, ticktick has other features which are not needed for the habit tracker.

- Having habits be connected so you can have seperate habits for 10 minutes meditating, 15 minutes, but you can link them together
so you can see your overall tiem meditating

- ? Ability to set goals within the app for specific habits, like "about my habit of running, I want to run 10k, and then you can see
your log history for one of those basically...

- ? Ability to track metrics and behaviours seperately, to acknowledge them, or maybe treat them differently in some way, like not coming up
on the statistics page



- Have it so a user can go on, and be able to have all basic functionality, have it be usable
  - What are these features?
    - be able to view habit completions past 1 week ago
    - be able to rename habits



  
What is the overall goal of the product to be?

- A platform that allows you to use a habit tracker with all the feature you'd need to set and update goals
