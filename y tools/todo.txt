- make habit options button work fully for: renaming, archiving, deleting, unarchiving habits



- make a week view and a day view, for a better experience on mobile?

background becomes invisible, as there's no date

"PROGRESSIVE / GEN-2" features it could/should have:

data:
- ability to bulk import and export habit data as CSV
- ability to export statistics data as CSV
- ability to add your own code and features, and and a plugin market for that
- the ability to host it on your own machine, locally?

habits
- ability to link habits together, so you can change variables for habits, like how long you did it for, but it will still count towards the same statistical unit
- ability to do "custom habit sessions" where you can record progress, but it still gets recorded for your statistics

SURROUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE:
- organisation visualiser, that shows EXACTLY how your money is used by the habit tracker, for: STAFF, databases, software et cetera.
